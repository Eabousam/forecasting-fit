              Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) 18 years ago, a large number of {SARS}-related coronaviruses ({SARSr}-{CoVs}) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats 
              1–4 
              . Previous studies have shown that some bat {SARSr}-{CoVs} have the potential to infect humans 
              5–7 
              . Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-{nCoV}), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6\% sequence identity to {SARS}-{CoV}. Furthermore, we show that 2019-{nCoV} is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of . In addition, 2019-{nCoV} virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-{nCoV} uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme {II} ({ACE}2)—as {SARS}-{CoV}.},

	abstract = {In its largest outbreak, Ebola virus disease is spreading through Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria. We sequenced 99 Ebola virus genomes from 78 patients in Sierra Leone to {\textasciitilde}2000× coverage. We observed a rapid accumulation of interhost and intrahost genetic variation, allowing us to characterize patterns of viral transmission over the initial weeks of the epidemic. This West African variant likely diverged from central African lineages around 2004, crossed from Guinea to Sierra Leone in May 2014, and has exhibited sustained human-to-human transmission subsequently, with no evidence of additional zoonotic sources. Because many of the mutations alter protein sequences and other biologically meaningful targets, they should be monitored for impact on diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies critical to outbreak response.},

	abstract = {The term ‘pathogen emergence’ encompasses everything from novel viruses entering the human population to established pathogens invading new populations, to the evolution of drug resistance. Mathematical models of emergent pathogens allow forecasts of case numbers, investigation of transmission mechanisms, and evaluation of control options. Yet, there are numerous limitations and pitfalls to their use, often driven by data scarcity. Growing availability of data on pathogen genetics and human ecology, coupled with computational and methodological innovations, are amplifying the power of models to inform the public health response to emergence events. Tighter integration of infectious disease models with public health practice, and development of resources at the ready have the potential to increase the timeliness and quality of responses.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}: Disease outbreaks of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, pandemic H1N1, H7N9, H5N1, Ebola, Zika, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and recently {COVID}-19 have raised the attention of the public over the past half-century. Revealing the characteristics and epidemic trends are important parts of disease control. The biological scenarios including transmission characteristics can be constructed and translated into mathematical models, which can help to predict and gain a deeper understanding of diseases.
{AREAS} {COVERED}: This review discusses the models for infectious diseases and highlights their values in the field of public health. This information will be of interest to mathematicians and clinicians, and make a significant contribution toward the development of more specific and effective models. Literature searches were performed using the online database of {PubMed} (inception to August 2020).
{EXPERT} {OPINION}: Modeling could contribute to infectious disease control by means of predicting the scales of disease epidemics, indicating the characteristics of disease transmission, evaluating the effectiveness of interventions or policies, and warning or forecasting during the pre-outbreak of diseases. With the development of theories and the ability of calculations, infectious disease modeling would play a much more important role in disease prevention and control of public health.},
