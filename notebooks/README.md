# Model Run Notebook

This notebook provides code for variant frequency forecasting and growth advantage estimation using different models ['GARW','MLR', 'Piantham', 'FGA'] and provides specification
for a naive model. It does that by performing the following functions:

1. Specification of analysis period and geographical settings: Define the observation dates and geographical settings for the analysis.

2. Assigning Parameters and forecasting period: Set the parameters and forecasting periods for the models.

3. Model Definitions:

Fixed Growth Advantage (FGA): A model for variant frequency forecasting and growth advantage estimation.
Varying Growth Advantage Random Walk (GARW): Another model for variant frequency forecasting and growth advantage estimation.
Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR): A model for variant frequency forecasting using logistic regression.
Piantham Model: A model for variant frequency forecasting and growth advantage estimation.
Naive Model Specification: A simple naive forecasting model for variant frequencies.

4. Running the Models to obtain variant frequency forecasts and growth advantage estimates for each model and location.
