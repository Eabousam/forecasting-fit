## Running the Models

This notebook provides code for variant frequency forecasting and growth advantage estimation using different models ['GARW','MLR', 'Piantham', 'FGA'] and provides specification
for a naive model. It does that by performing the following functions:

1. Specification of analysis period and geographical settings: Define the observation dates and geographical settings for the analysis.

2. Assigning Parameters and forecasting period: Set the parameters and forecasting periods for the models along with model definition specification.

4. Running the Models to obtain variant frequency forecasts and growth advantage estimates for each model and location.
