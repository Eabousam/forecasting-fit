## About

### Evoluationary forecasting: model comparison and evaluation

Eslam Abousamra, Marlin Figgins, John Huddleston, Trevor Bedford

The **#ncov-forecasting-fit** repository hosts as a framework to evaluate evolutionary forecasting models through establishing a pipeline to process cov-variant data at different timepoints. Analyses include Model comparison and evaluation, Comparison of growth advantages, Examination of data quality reflection to error.



## Data Processing

### Creating datasets



### Running Models

The notebooks allow for obtaining bayesian inference outputs (nowcasting and forecasting) of different inferencing models and provides scoring methodologies to compare the different models.


### Growth Advantage Script





### Scoring Script

The **scoring script** intakes posterior outputs from versioned models data and outputs scores for predictive probability distributions. The output file from the script pipeline contains score values for each date run for each location and model type.
