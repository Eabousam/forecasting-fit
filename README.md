# ncov-forecasting-fit


The **#ncov-forecasting-fit** repository hosts as a framework to test the #evofr modeling package through establishing a way to process cov-variant data at different timepoints. The notebooks allow for obtaining bayesian inference outputs (nowcasting and forecasting) of different inferencing models and provides methods to estimate scores of the different models. 

The **scoring script** intakes posterior outputs from versioned models data and outputs scores for predictive probability distributions. The output file from the script pipeline contains score values for each date run for each location and model type (attached below).
