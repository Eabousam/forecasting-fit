# ncov-forecasting-fit


The **#ncov-forecasting-fit** repository hosts as a framework to test the #evofr modeling package through establishing a way to process cov-variant data at different timepoints. The notebooks allow for obtaining bayesian inference outputs (nowcasting and forecasting) of different inferencing models and provides methods to estimate scores of the different models.
